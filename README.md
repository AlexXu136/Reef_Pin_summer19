# D-SEA: The Depth-Sensor Enclosed Application
## Project Overview
### Abstract
Depth information is crucial in the creation of underwater 3D interactive models. Divers and researchers need depth measurements to accurately depict the structure and levels of underwater architectures for a virtual reality marine ecosystem. Currently, divers are manually measuring the depth using dive watches, but this method is inconsistent because of variable depth readings caused by changing wave heights and human errors.  To combat these problems, we created Depth-Sensor Enclosed Application (D-SEA) to automatically collect and average pressure data while displaying the calculated depth readings with values up to 30 meters underwater which is 3 times more than expected diving conditions. This device can be easily assembled with a cost of under one-hundred dollars.  Building from past developments, we are working on an affordable, waterproof prototype with a display that is readable underwater, an automatic transition between on and off states when submerged in seawater, and automatic data logging onto an SD card. From testing the recent prototype in a pool, results show that the D-SEA is able to accurately calculate the depth and display it on the screen.

### 100 Island Challenge
Our project falls within the greater context of the 100 Island Challenge, headed by the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. The 100 Island Challenge is a project that is collecting photographic, geographic, and oceanographic data in order to build models of coral reef communities around the world and track their changes in structure and growth over time. More information on the challenge can be found [here](http://100islandchallenge.org/).

### Requirements
Researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography wish to work with this device under the following conditions: Bring the device on a boat and turn it on before going diving with the corals. Then they dive down and place the devices on the coral reef, and the device starts collecting depth information and displaying it on the screen. The divers swim back and forth to do the photomosaic survey, capturing images of the devices and the data shown on the screen. After that, they collect the devices and return to the boat. They read the data from the devices and download it for backup. Finally, they turn off the device and charge the device overnight.

### Objectives
Based on the requirements from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, we are building a device that can measure and display depth information when it’s placed on coral reefs. Then the depth information could be captured by cameras and retrieved from images. The other detailed functions are described as follows.
* Switch: A switch is needed to make sure the device can turn on before diving and turn off when it’s back to land. 
* Waterproof: Since the device needs to be working under 10-15 meters of salt water for around 4 hours, it should be strictly waterproof to avoid erosion. Waterproof also means that there may not be any buttons or plugs on this device.
* Clear display: The device works in relatively shallow, high-illumination conditions in coral reef communities. There will be sunlight, wind, and wave changing over time. The display module should display the depth information as clear as possible under different conditions to make sure the information can be retrieved from the images accurately.
* Rechargeable: The device needs to be reusable and rechargeable. The battery needs to be working for around 4 hours and can be charged fully over one night.
* Data storage: There may be cases that researchers fail to retrieve accurate depth information from unclear images. For backup consideration, this device should be integrated with a data storage module such as an SD-card.
